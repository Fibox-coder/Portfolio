        <p>One of my most educational projects. The main goal of this project was to learn more about how to implement Object Constructors. In addition I had to create a modal for adding books and accepting user input (which was quite similar to previous "create a form" projects). <br><br> It also expended my knowledge about saving data in the localStorage.<br><br></p>

        <p> This was my end project for the LOI course. Very challenging, with a lot of diverse Javascript problems to be solved. From  determining how to match the cards to keeping track of the score (and save the highscore). <br><br> Not to mention all the little things like adding sound when a card is clicked, creating a timer, fetching data from a json file and utilizing class constructor.<br><br></p>

        </a>
        <p>Making a calculator was a project for The Odin Project and the LOI course. One of the great things about doing this project twice is how I could actually see the improvement from my first try. The code is a lot more cleaner, and I learned the importance of repeating something from scratch and trying to improve over the first iteration.<br><br>On my second try I also really tried to emphasize good "commenting". Not only does it help for colleagues in a working environment, but also for my future self! <br><br></p>

        </a>
        <p>With this project I focused on creating a replica version of Coolblue. I absolutely love the design of this website and how clean it looks, which is why I choose this specific website. I had to utilize "flexbox" in CSS a lot in this project, which made me much more comfortable with it in future projects.<br><br>I also used online HTML and CSS validators to make sure the code was correct and fixed any mistakes. And had to use a lot of Media Queries to make sure it was responsive on smaller screens.  <br><br></p>

        </a>
        <p>The goal of this project was mainly to learn as much as I can about "grid" in CSS. Up to this point I most often used flexbox to solve CSS layout problems. But I knew that in some cases grid would be much more useful. So I created a social media dashboard with a very "grid-like" design.<br><br>Figuring out how to create the optimal code in CSS for the Frontend layout is one of my favorite things to do! <br><br></p>

        <p>A project that utilizes a loop to let the user pick the size of their board and create that many squares to "draw" on. It was a fun challenge to get the loop right, especially with the slider that the user could use to easily change board sizes.  <br><br> I'm glad that I solved the problem with the slider included. It is a lot more userfriendly than asking the user with a prompt. <br><br></p>

        <p>This project was part of a course about HTML and CSS I followed online. Other than the basics of clean HTML and CSS code, I learned a lot from all the exercises in the course about replicating UI elements from big websites like Amazon, Spotify, Discord etc.  <br><br>It made me think a lot more about design interface decisions. for example, how a button looks, what happens when the user hovers over it, what happens to it when its pressed, etc.<br><br></p>

        <p>the Rock Paper Scissors game has some fun problems to be solved. How to start the game, how to decide who won the round, how to decide who won the game, etc. This was one of my first challenging projects as a junior developer.<br><br>While I personally prefer creating applications like libraries / calculators over games, I do see a big value in them for developing coding skills. As they have some great logic problems that have to be solved.<br><br></p>
